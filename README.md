# Presentation
I made this game with the help of one of my classmates. Our goal was to make a game in less than 24 hours with a framework that we didn't know. We chose to use the Monogame framework.

#The game
You can jump from planet to planet with the space key or turn around with the directional arrows. If you miss a planet and the cube falls, you will not be able to play again, all you have to do is close the window and restart the game.

# Conclusion
Our goal was achieved, the game was completed in around 10 hours. This project taught me not only how to use the Monogame framework, but also how to use the C# language, which I had never programmed in before.
